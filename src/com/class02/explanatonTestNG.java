//	        How do I verify in TestNG?
//			In TestNG, Verify is implemented using SoftAssert class. 
//			In case of SoftAssert, all the statements in the test method are executed
//			(including multiple assertions). Once, all the statements are executed, 
//			the test result is collated based on the assertion results and test is marked as passed or fail.

	// dependsOnMethods to tell TestNG which methods this test is dependent on,
    //so those methods should be executed before this method
    //alphbetical<priority<dependsOnMethods
